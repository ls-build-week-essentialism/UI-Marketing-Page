                <h1>Essentialism</h1>
                <h2>The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</h2>
                <p>You have to make these big decisions. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.
                If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.
                There are no limits in this world. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.</p>
